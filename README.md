# Introduction

First of all, welcome! Good to have you here! This wiki is where you can find all the information you need to know to
start making plugins for Krypton!

Now, without further or do, maybe I should guide you through a few of the pages in this wiki.

* You can get started with the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) page. This will walk you through some of the basics
on how you can actually set up your environment and start making plugins!
* Then, maybe you want some commands? No problem! [Commands](commands.md) has you covered! This page has everything you 
should ever need to know about Krypton's commands on it.

## Contributing

If you have anything you want to contribute to this wiki, feel free to submit a pull request on GitHub! Or maybe you
have something to contribute to Krypton itself? We love those too!
